\frametitle{Example}
In our example the $T$ statistic was $0.8$. What's the probability of getting
a $T$ statistic as large as $0.8$?
\begin{verbatim}
pt(0.8, 15, lower.tail = FALSE) ##works out to be 0.22
\end{verbatim}
Therefore, the probability of seeing evidence as extreme or more
extreme than that actually obtained is $0.22$
